# Cranberry_Practice_Site

## Description

This Project is just a way for me to practice my skills by taking a design and turning it into a HTML and CSS website. Please note that the website does not have any functionality and is not deployed. There are also aspects of this project that could be improved such as web responsiveness, but my intention for this project was just to copy the design concept. The design and concept for this website can be found here: https://dribbble.com/shots/11030266-E-commerce-Website. I take no credit for the design and concept. My only goal here was to recreate the design using HTML and CSS. I also took some liberties with certain design elements such as colors, fonts, and images as I do not have access to these elements from the original design.
